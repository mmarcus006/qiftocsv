# Project Overview

## Executive Summary
This project involves developing a Python-based application with a simple user interface (UI) that allows users to upload QIF (Quicken Interchange Format) files and convert them into CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. The primary goal is to provide a straightforward tool for managing and converting financial data, enabling users to easily manipulate and analyze their financial information using widely supported CSV files. The application will feature a clean and intuitive UI, ensuring accessibility for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

## Project Scope

### Included Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login system to ensure that only authorized users can access the application.
- **QIF File Upload:** Functionality for users to upload QIF files through the UI.
- **Conversion Engine:** Backend process to accurately convert QIF files to CSV format.
- **CSV Download:** Option for users to download the converted CSV files.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error messages and handling mechanisms for unsupported files or conversion issues.
- **User Interface:** A user-friendly UI built with Python's Tkinter library (or an alternative framework), providing ease of use and navigation.
- - **Advanced Data Analytics:** Beyond basic conversion, the application will not offer data analysis or visualization tools.
- **Support for Additional File Formats:** The scope is limited to QIF to CSV conversion without supporting other financial file formats.


### Excluded Features
- **Cloud Integration:** The application will not include features for uploading or downloading files from cloud storage services.

## Requirements Gathering

### Functional Requirements
1. **File Upload:** Users must be able to select and upload QIF files through the UI.
2. **Conversion Process:** The application must convert the uploaded QIF files accurately to CSV format.
3. **File Download:** Users must be able to download the converted CSV files from the application.
4. **Validation:** The application must validate the integrity of the uploaded QIF files before conversion.
5. **User Feedback:** Provide real-time feedback and status updates during the upload and conversion processes.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance:** The application should handle QIF files up to 10MB without significant delays.
2. **Usability:** The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate for users with basic technical knowledge.
3. **Maintainability:** Code should be well-documented and organized to facilitate future updates and maintenance.

### User Stories
- **US1:** As a user, I want to upload a QIF file so that I can convert it to a CSV format for easier data manipulation.
- **US2:** As a user, I want to download the converted CSV file so that I can use it in spreadsheet applications like Excel.
- **US3:** As a user, I want to receive clear error messages if the QIF file upload fails or if the conversion is unsuccessful.
- **US4:** As a user, I want the application to be easy to navigate so that I can convert files without technical assistance.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The application allows users to upload QIF files without errors.
- QIF files are converted accurately to CSV format, preserving all necessary data fields.
- Users can download the converted CSV files without issues.
- The application provides informative error messages for invalid file uploads or conversion failures.
- The UI is responsive and user-friendly across different operating systems.

### Constraints
- Development will be completed using Python 3.x.
- The UI framework chosen must support cross-platform compatibility.
- The project must be completed within a 3-month timeline.
- The application will handle only QIF to CSV conversions without support for other formats.

The system architecture consists of the following components:
- **User Interface (UI):** Built with Tkinter, the UI allows users to upload QIF files and download the converted CSV files. It also provides status updates and error messages.
- **File Handler Module:** Manages the uploading and downloading of files, ensuring secure and efficient file transfer.
- **Conversion Engine:** Contains the logic for parsing QIF files and generating CSV output. It leverages existing Python libraries for file manipulation and conversion.
- **Error Handling Module:** Captures and logs errors that occur during file upload, conversion, or download processes, providing feedback to the user.

## Technical Design

### Data Models
- **QIFParser:** A class responsible for reading and parsing QIF files, extracting relevant financial data.
- **CSVGenerator:** A class responsible for generating CSV files from the parsed QIF data, ensuring proper formatting and data integrity.

### APIs
- **Local APIs:** The application will use local Python functions and libraries to handle file operations and conversions. No external APIs are required.

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **UI Framework:** Tkinter or PyQt or Flask or Streamlit
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and CSV generation.
  - `PyQt` or `Tkinter` for advanced UI components (optional based on UI complexity).
- **Version Control:** Git for managing project source code and documentation.

## Development Plan

1. **Phase 1: Setup**
   - Initialize the project repository on GitHub.
   - Set up a Python virtual environment.
   - Install necessary dependencies and libraries.

2. **Phase 2: UI Development**
   - Design the main application window layout.
   - Implement file upload functionality in the UI.
   - Implement file download functionality in the UI.

3. **Phase 3: Conversion Engine Development**
   - Develop the `QIFParser` class to read and parse QIF files.
   - Develop the `CSVGenerator` class to create CSV files from parsed data.
   - Integrate the conversion engine with the UI.

4. **Phase 4: Testing**
   - Write unit tests for the `QIFParser` and `CSVGenerator` classes.
   - Conduct integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between UI and backend.
   - Perform user acceptance testing to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

5. **Phase 5: Deployment**
   - Package the application for distribution on various operating systems.
   - Create user documentation and guides.
   - Release the application to the intended user base.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components like `QIFParser` and `CSVGenerator` to ensure they function correctly with various QIF file inputs.

### Integration Testing
- Verify that the UI correctly interacts with the file handler and conversion engine.
- Ensure that file uploads and downloads work seamlessly with the conversion process.

### System Testing
- Test the entire application workflow from file upload to CSV download.
- Validate performance with large QIF files to ensure no significant delays.

### User Acceptance Testing
- Engage a group of users to test the application in real-world scenarios.
- Collect feedback and identify any usability or functionality issues.

## Best Practices for Initial Project Documentation

### Identify Target Audience
The documentation is tailored for developers, testers, project managers, and stakeholders involved in the project. It provides comprehensive information to facilitate understanding, development, testing, and project management processes.

### Regular Updates
Documentation will be maintained and updated regularly to reflect any changes in project scope, requirements, technical design, or development progress. This ensures that all stakeholders have access to the most current information.

### Collaboration Tools
Utilize GitHub for version control and collaborative documentation. The repository will host the project plan, System Architecture diagrams, UI wireframes, and other necessary documents. Use GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to manage feedback and changes.

### Clear and Concise Writing
Documentation will use clear and straightforward language to avoid misunderstandings. Jargon will be minimized, and relevant visuals like diagrams and flowcharts will be included to enhance comprehension.

### Review and Feedback Loop
Establish a regular review process where team members can provide feedback on the documentation. Incorporate suggestions and updates based on input from developers, testers, and stakeholders to ensure the documentation remains accurate and useful.
