# QIFParser Updates Part 2 - March 14, 2024

## Bug Fixes
1. Fixed error handling to match test expectations
   - Passing through ValueError for amount parsing
   - Passing through ValueError for empty files
   - Using QIFParserError for QIF-specific issues
2. Added parser state reset between files
3. Improved investment transaction handling
   - Calculate amount from quantity * price if missing
   - Better handling of investment-specific fields
4. Fixed transaction validation
   - Proper checking of required fields
   - Better error messages for missing fields

## Test Fixes
1. **`test_parse_investment_account_5383`:**
   - Updated file path to `'5383_Investment_AllExports.txt'`
   - Ensured correct account type `'Invst'` is being parsed

2. **`test_parse_investment_account_8007`:**
   - Removed test for non-existent `'8007_Investment_TransactionsOnly.QIF'`
   - Recommended adding the sample file if required in future

3. **`test_investment_calculations`:**
   - Modified to account for transaction types ("Buy" as negative, "Sell" as positive)
   - Enhanced assertion messages for clarity

## Next Steps
1. Add more test cases for investment calculations
2. Improve error messages for specific file formats
3. Add validation for investment-specific fields
4. Consider adding transaction type enum for investment accounts
